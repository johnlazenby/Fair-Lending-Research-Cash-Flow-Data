# Fair-Lending-Research-Cash-Flow-Data
Although I spent 90% of my time at Charles River Associates writing code for statistical analysis most of that work was confidential. This is a research project I worked on that was not confidential. We investigate if FinTech companies using cash flow data in underwriting leads to disparate impact against protected classes.

In the report we find that
* the cash flow data standing alone leads to predictive performance simmilar to traditional credit scores
* the customers being served by these companies using cash flow data are relatively underserved by the traditional mechanisms of receiving credit
* there was no disparate as a result of using cash flow data

Here is a link to the report: [cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit-empirical-research-findings](https://finreglab.org/cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit-empirical-research-findings)

I included a pdf version of the report in this repository as well.
